        <p>Thank you for using MasterPassword for Firefox! The easiest way to handle site-unique password on the web.
        If you want to understand what this is all about, please see <a href="http://masterpasswordapp.com/">here</a>.
        <p>You've chosen to install a beta release of this addon. Thank you for beeing an early adopter! If you find
        any bugs or missing features, please report them on the <a href="https://github.com/ttyridal/masterpassword-firefox/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>.
        <p>Mozilla is fundamentally changing the environment for addons. This version adapts the webextensions api, which is the
        future for Firefox. For you that means that some of MasterPassword for Firefox' behaviour is changed:
        <h3>Users of OS' key-vault</h3>
        <p>If you're using GNOME Keyring, KWallet, OSX Keychain or Windows Password Vault to store your master key, you'll need to
        download a separate helper app. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/ttyridal/masterpassword-firefox/wiki/Webextensions" target="_blank">the wiki</a> for further information.
        <h3>Keyboard shortcut</h3>
        <p>It is no longer possible to change the keyboard shortcut. If this is causing you too much trouble, please add your concerns
        to <a href="https://github.com/ttyridal/masterpassword-firefox/issues/32">this issue</a>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>If you're happy with this addon and haven't done so already, please consider
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/masterpassword-firefox/reviews/add">rating it</a>.
