        download a separate helper app. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/ttyridal/masterpassword-firefox/wiki/Webextensions" target="_blank">the wiki</a> for further information.
        <h3>Changes since v2.2</h3>

        <li>This release is the same as v2.2, but built purely for the webextensions api and thus supporting Firefox 57 and beyond.
        </ul>
